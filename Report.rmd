Project is divided into 3 categories -

1. Data Processing
2. Data Analysis
3. Data Visualization

Part 1 - Data Processing

In this section, first I imported the data from ftp://eclipse.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/ibtracs/v03r06/wmo/hurdat_format/basin/Basin.NA.ibtracs_hurdat.v03r06.hdat

This data was categorized into 3 parts - Header, Daily Data and Trailer

After importing the dataset, I created two Comma Separated Values (CSV) files named storms.csv and tracks.csv

storms.csv

To create storms.csv, I used Header section of the imported data having following columns - 
Storm ID
Date
Days of Storm
Name of Storm

tracks.csv

To create tracks.csv, I used Header as well as Daily Data section of the imported data having following columns - 
Storm ID
Date
Period
Stage
Latitude
Longitude
Wind
Pressure

Purpose behind creating these two files was to ease the data analysis part which is the next section.

Part 2 - Data Analysis

In this section, using the above created files, I found out some key insights using R functions.

This Analysis has two categories - Descriptive and Predictive

Descriptive Analysis
In this part, using the storms.csv, I performed following statistics - 
Yearly Basis
Monthly Basis

Finally, I created a table that displays Standard Deviation and different percentiles for different types of storms depending upon their wind speed.

Predictive Analytics
This part was implemented using Linear Regression Analysis on Mean and Median.
Used regression function in R to get the slope and intercept of the regression line which could be later used for predicting. 

Plotted these regression lines between Pressure and Wind Speed which makes it easier to predict one of them based on the other one.

Part 3 - Data Visualization

Final part of this project was Data Visualization. Main purpose of this part was to plot trajectories of all storms from 1980-2010. 

These visualizations were categorized into 3 parts - 

Yearly Basis
Monthly Basis
Decade - Wise

These are the PNG files that were generated.
